	T lymphocytes recognize specific \gls{acropMHC} combinations presented on the surface of \gls{acroAPC}. This highly specific recognition is mediated by the \gls{acroTCR}, an extremely diverse heterodimeric cell-surface protein comprising an $\alpha- $ and a $ \beta- $chain encoded by gene produced by recombination of V(D)J loci during T cell development. The DNA sequence diversity of mouse \gls{acroTCR} has been estimated as $ 5 \times 10^{21} $ different paired combinations.
